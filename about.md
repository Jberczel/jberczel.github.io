My name is Jamie.  I've been studying web development since returning from my [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com).

If you're looking to learn programming/web development, here are some of the resources I used and recommend:

* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) - Building a Search Engine and Web App Development courses are solid foundation to begin learning computer science and web development. Both courses use python programming language, and the web development course also uses Google App Engine.
* [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses) - great place to learn ruby, rails, html/css, jQuery, javascript and other web-related technologies.
* [exercism](http://exercism.io/) - hone your ruby skills by completing all the ruby exercises.
