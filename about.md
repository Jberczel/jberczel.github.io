My name is Jamie.  I've been studying web development since returning from my [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com).

Before the hike, I completed two [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses: Building a Search Engine and Web App Development. In addition, I learned basic html and css from various other online resources.

After returning from over 5 months in the woods, I had forgotten quite a bit.  I needed a refresher, and luckily, stumbled upon the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses). 

In short, I found it highly engaging and comprehensive. The course layout and material were exactly what I was looking for. It was a lot of fun, and kept me motivated.

Today, I continue to hone my coding skills with [exercism](http://exercism.io/), a website filled with practice problems in multiple languages, where users provide real world feedback.
