My name is Jamie.  I've been studying web development since I returned from my [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com).

Before discoveirng the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses), I completed two courses at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): Building a Search Engine and Web App Development.

Completing both courses was a rewarding experience, and it gave me the skills to build a website for my thru-hike.

When I returned from my hike, I had forgotten a lot of the detail. While I was re-learning, I discovered the Odin curriculum.

In short, I found it highly engaging, informative, and just plain old fun. I haven't looked back and hope to complete the curriculum by the end of the summer (2014).
