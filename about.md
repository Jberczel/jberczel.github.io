My name is Jamie.  I've been studying web development since returning from my 2013 [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com).

Before the hike, I completed two [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses: Building a Search Engine and Web App Development. In addition, I learned basic html and css from various other online resources.

After returning from 5 months in the woods, I had forgotten quite a bit.  I needed a refresher, and luckily, stumbled upon the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses). 

In short, I find it highly engaging and comprehensive. The course layout and material were exactly what I was looking for. I'm having a lot of fun working through the projects and plan to complete the curriculum by the end of the summer (2014).
