My name is Jamie.  I've been studying web development since returning from my 2013 [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com).

Before discoverirng the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses), I completed two courses at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): Building a Search Engine and Web App Development.  In addition, I learned some front-end development from other online resources such as nettuts and codeacademy.

Completing the Udacity courses was a rewarding experience, and it gave me the skills to build a website for my thru-hike.

However, after returning from 5 months on the trail, I had forgotten a lot of the detail. I needed a refresher, and luckily, stumbled upon the Odin curriculum.

In short, I found the Odin Curriculum highly engaging, informative, and just plain old fun. I haven't looked back and plan to complete the curriculum by the end of the summer (2014).
