<h2>Narrator</h2>

<p>
  No lad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket, is very sad, and Barry rode towards Dublin thinking not so much of the kind mother left alone, and of the home behind him, but of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring.
</p>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>
  It was in the reign of George III</br>
  that the aforesaid personages lived and quaralled;</br>
  good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor</br>
  they are all equal now.
