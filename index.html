<h2>Narrator</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    No lad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket, is very sad, and Barry rode towards Dublin thinking not so much of the kind mother left alone, and of the home behind him, but of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is well to dream of glorious war in a snug armchair at home, but it is a very different thing to see it first hand. And after the death of his friend, Barry's thoughts turned from those of military glory to those of finding a way to escape the service to which he was now tied for another six years. Gentlemen may talk of the age of chivalry, but remember the ploughmen, poachers and pickpockets whom they lead. It is with these sad instruments that your great warriors and kings have been doing their murderous work in the world.
  </li>

  <li>
    Barry had his faults, but none could say of him that he was not a good and tender father. He loved his son with a blind impartiality, denying him nothing. It is impossible to convey what high hopes he had for the boy, and how he indulged in fond anticipation of young Bryan's future success. But Fate had determined that he should leave none of his race behind him...and that he should finish his life poor, lonely, and childless.
  </li>

  <li>
    Utterly baffled and beaten, what was the lonely and broken-hearted man to do? He took the annuity and returned to Ireland with his mother to complete his recovery. Sometime later he travelled to the Continent. His life there, we have not the means of following accurately. But he appears to have resumed his former profession of a gambler without his former success. He never saw Lady Lyndon again.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

  that the aforesaid personages lived and quaralled;</br>

  they are all equal now
