Well, it's been awhile since I've blogged anything here.  I've finished the Odin Curriculum,
which was an invaluable tool for self-study.  Being one of the first people to post
solutions to the projects, it was sometimes quite challenging figuring things out. But in the end, it was very rewarding.

In the future, I hope the Odin communities grows, and opens avenues for more collaborative coding experiences.  I'm thinking [exercism](http://exercism.io/) at the level of small projects, not small problem sets.

Finishing Odin felt similar to when I first picked up a guitar. It's only the beginning of a long journey. I'm excited to see what I build next.  

In the meantime, I've restructured this website to include a [portfolio](http://jberczel.github.io) on the home page.
I hope you enjoy.
