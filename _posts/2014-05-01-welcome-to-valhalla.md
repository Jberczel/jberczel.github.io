I am currently working on projects in the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/home). 

I created this website to record my implementations/walkthroughs, organize my thoughts, and create a reference for me and future berserkers who get stuck and frustrated to the point of madness.

It took me an afternoon to get the website set up and deployed. It is hosted on github pages and generated with jekyll and poole.

###The Tools:

- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - host directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - blog using beautiful Markdown syntax, and without having to deal with any databases.
- [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - provides a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

###Build your own github and jekyll website

Read a great step-by-step guide [here](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). It took me an afternoon to get it set up with disqus comments.
