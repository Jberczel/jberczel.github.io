title: 6 Reasons I Like the Odin Curriculum
---

Since returning from my 2013 [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com), I've been studying and working through the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses). Previously, I had studied web app develompent for 3-4 months primarily at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and other online resources.

 I was able to build my frist real website, but when I returned, I had forgotten a lot of the detail. I needed a refresher and found the Odin Project. Here are the reasons why I am now sticking with the Odin curriculum.

##1. It's a Great Map and Guide
When I solo hiked the Appalachian trail (2,200 miles), I had a [guidebook](http://www.amazon.com/The-A-T-Guide-Southbound-2013/dp/0982980833/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1399332731&sr=8-2&keywords=awol+guide+southbound) with small maps, elevation profiles, distance markers, and all sorts of useful information.  I'm not sure if I could've successfully hiked from Maine to Georgia without it.

When attempting the huge feat of learning web development on your own, I view the Odin curriclum as a great guide. It's filled with small projects, detailed explanations, links to helpful resources, and a supportive community.  

It's a guide that keeps you on trail, and drastically reduces those moments you feel lost in the woods.

##2. Repository of Learning Tools
I studied regular expressions briefly when deploying my first real website, but the Odin curriculum directed me to [regexone](http://regexone.com/), which I wish I discovered when I first started learning regular expressions.  

Similarly, I enjoyed re-learning about git version control from [atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial), which I also found via the Odin curriculum.  

These links are just a few of the awesome resources you can find following along with the curriculum.

##3. Small Goals Create Momentum

>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Learning web development, especially on your own, can be extremely daunting.  Rather than trying to tackle one big project, breaking it down into smaller pieces and taking it day by day are sound advice.

Completing small projects is fun and leads to bigger goals and projects.

As an example, I've enjoyed working on small projects such as the [sketchpad](https://github.com/Jberczel/odin-projects/tree/master/sketchpad) project (intro to jQuery technology).

Like learning a musical instrument, it takes time, deliberate practice, and patience to achieve success. By working on small projects, you avoid a lot of frustration, and learn to enjoy the process.

##4. Well-Timed Learning

I am learning a little of everything at the appropriate time and discovering how each web technology fits into the bigger picture.

I've learned just enough about the command line, git version control, html/css, Ruby language, object-oriented programming, databases, and alogrithms to complete each successive project.

When projects become more complex, you learn more about each technology. 

I think this approach is better than learning all the tools independently.  That would be like spending a month learning html/css, and then after that, spending a month learning back-end development and databases.  Ideally, you should be learning both for two months to reinforce learning and see the connection between both technologies.


##5 Building a Portfolio

At Udacity, I'd watch short, 5-minute videos and solve small problems until getting to bigger problem sets at the end of each lesson.  I enjoyed this style of learning, but this is where I think the Odin Project stands out.  Rather than just submitting small code snippets, you're constantly writing and pushing code to github.

You have a record of your code from the very beginning.  It's not the best-written code, but you can trace your progress and always go back to review. It's all easily accessible in your github account.

Psychologically, it's nice to see all your work in one place.  It gives you a sesne of accomplishment, and I'm sure it'll be interesting to look back at in a year or two to see how far you've progressed.


##6. Open Community and Founder

There are volunteers running study groups/sessions. After writing a few walkthroughs, I can appreciate how much time and effort some of the original contributors put into this project.

It also doesn't hurt that it is a free, open-source, [curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).
