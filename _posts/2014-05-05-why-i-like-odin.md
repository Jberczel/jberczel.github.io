After returning from my 2013 [thru-hike](http://www.atjindo.com), I began re-learning web development. Thankfully, I stumbled upon the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses).

Before my big trip, I studied web app development mainly at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and was able to build my first 'real' website.  However, when I returned, I had forgotten a lot of the detail. I needed a refresher and found the Odin Project. Here are the reasons why I am now sticking with the Odin curriculum.

##1. It's a Great Map and Guide

When I solo hiked the Appalachian trail (2,200 miles), I had a [guidebook](http://www.amazon.com/The-A-T-Guide-Southbound-2013/dp/0982980833/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1399332731&sr=8-2&keywords=awol+guide+southbound). It had small maps, elevation profiles, distance markers, and other useful information. It was one of my 'must have' essential items for successfully hiking from Maine to Georgia.

When attempting the huge feat of learning web development, the Odin curriculum is like a great guide. It's filled with small projects, detailed explanations, links to helpful resources, and a supportive community.  

It keeps you on trail, and cuts down the time you feel completely lost in the woods.

##2. Repository of Learning Tools
I studied regular expressions briefly when deploying my first real website, but had little experience and a vague understanding.

The Odin curriculum directed me to [regexone](http://regexone.com/), which I wish I discovered a long time ago.

Similarly, I enjoyed reviewing git version control from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial). 

These links are just a few of the awesome resources you can find following along with the curriculum.

##3. Small Goals Create Momentum

>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Learning web development, especially on your own, can be extremely daunting.  Big projects are scary and easily derail you.

Completing small projects is fun, builds momentum, and leads to bigger goals and projects.  After working through a few small projects, some of the bigger projects don't look as overwhelming, once you've put a few of the pieces together.

As an example, I enjoyed working on a [sketchpad](https://github.com/Jberczel/odin-projects/tree/master/sketchpad) project, which is a basic introduction to jQuery. I plan to build on this knowledge for future projects.

Like learning a musical instrument, it takes time, deliberate practice, and patience to achieve success. By working on small projects, you avoid a lot of frustration, and learn to enjoy the process.

##4. Well-Timed Learning

I am learning a little of everything at the appropriate time and discovering how each web technology fits into the bigger picture.

I've learned just enough about the command line, git version control, html/css, Ruby language, object-oriented programming, databases, and algorithms to complete each successive project.

When projects become more complex, you learn more about each technology. 

I think this approach is better than learning all the tools independently.  That would be like spending a month learning html/css, and then after that, spending a month learning back-end development and databases.  Ideally, you should be learning both for two months to reinforce learning and see the connection between both technologies.


##5. Build a Portfolio

At Udacity, I'd watch short, 5-minute videos and solve small problems until getting to bigger problem sets at the end of each lesson.  I enjoyed this style of learning, but this is where I think the Odin Project stands out.  Rather than just submitting small code snippets, you're constantly writing and pushing code to github.

You have a record of your code from the very beginning.  It's not the best-written code, but you can trace your progress and always go back to review. It's all easily accessible in your github account.

Psychologically, it's nice to see all your work in one place.  It gives you a sense of accomplishment, and I'm sure it'll be interesting to look back at in a year or two to see how far you've progressed.


##6. Open Community and Founder

There are volunteers running study groups/sessions. After writing a few walkthroughs, I can appreciate how much time and effort some of the original contributors put into this project.

It also doesn't hurt that it is a free, open-source [curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).
