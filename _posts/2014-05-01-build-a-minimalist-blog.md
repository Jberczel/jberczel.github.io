##Purpose of this blog

I am currently working on projects in the [Odin curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses). 

This website serves two purposes:

1. Record my thoughts, implementations, and walkthroughs of some of the Odin projects, which can be used as reference.
2. Practice writing about coding and technical issues.

##The Tools

This website was created with the following tools:

- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - host directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - blog using beautiful Markdown syntax, and without having to deal with any databases.
- [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - provides a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

##Build your own github and jekyll website

Read a great step-by-step guide [here](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). It took me an afternoon to get it set up and deployed with disqus comments.

##Using Markdown in text editor to write posts
