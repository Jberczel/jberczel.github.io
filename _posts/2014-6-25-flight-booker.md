##Objective:
>In this project, you'll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you'll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. In this case, we'll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

This is a challenging project.  For me, it has been the most difficult stand-alone project in the Odin Curriculum thus far.  There are a lot of complex, moving pieces that need to be put together.  A walk-through would probably take me longer than the 12+ hours it took me to complete this project, so for now, I'll just link to my [demo](http://flight-booker.herokuapp.com/).

Also note that further in the Odin Ruby Course, you wil add "send e-mail" functionality to this project.  This [blog post](http://howilearnedrails.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/setting-up-email-in-a-rails-4-app-with-action-mailer-in-development-and-sendgrid-in-production-using-heroku/) helped me set up e-mail using Rails, Heroku, and SendGrid add-on.
